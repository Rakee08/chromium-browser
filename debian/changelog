  * Rebased chromium-browser on top of 45.0.2454.85 from Ubuntu Vivid.
  * debian/chromium-browser.desktop:
    - Restore "Internet" as the Name ("Chromium Web Browser" in Vivid).
    - Removed StartupNotify=true
  * debian/control:
    - Add build dependency on eos-shell-content-dev.
    - Remove build dependency on libgconf2-dev.
    - Remove dependency on chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra completely, so that
      the version with only-free codecs is the only one which gets installed.
  * debian/rules:
    - Limit ninja not to spawn new jobs if load average is greater than 6.
    - Do not use GConf.
    - Add Endless distro.
    - Add Google API keys for Endless and enable them (#2473).
    - Disable third party translations, as they are already in upstream.
    - Pass 'eoscontent' to debhelper tools.
    - Install the extra version of libffmpeg.so under /var/lib/codecs.
    - Convert RPATH to RUNPATH for all the relevant binaries.
  * debian/chromium-browser.sh.in:
    - Ensure /var/lib/codes/chromium-browser is prepended to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  * debian/chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra.install:
    - Install the libffmpeg.so library directly under /var/lib/codecs.
