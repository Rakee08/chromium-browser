    - Clean up many parts of debian/rules, wrt variable names
    - Set hardening on.
    - Use gold linker.

    - Disable Wallet service.
  * debian/compat: Use dh version 9.
  * debian/rules: Improve "cd;foo" logic.
  * debian/rules: Remove files in tar-copy pipelines, to conserve space. Fixes
    build failures in servers.
  * debian/rules: Move check steps into install steps. No need to be separate,
    and simplifies target names.
  * debian/rules: Make en-us locale files less magical, and simplify install.
  * debian/rules: Work around change to tar command param order with
    --exclude.
  * debian/rules: Don't use tcmalloc on armhf.
  * debian/rules: Remove precise-specific conditions. More simple.
  * debian/rules: In install-validation, don't use mktemp. Hard-code
    destination.
  * debian/patches/gsettings-display-scaling: Disable because code moved and
    needs refactoring.
  * debian/patches/display-scaling-default-value: Disable because probbly not
    needed any more.
  * debian/rules: widevine cdm is not really available in this source. No
    longer lie about that.
  * Set new GOOG keys to bisect service overuse problem.
